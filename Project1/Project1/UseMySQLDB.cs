//// PROGRAM:  UseMySqlDb
//// AUTHOR:  D. Kaminski
//// SOFTWARE:  Visual Studio 2010, MySQL 5.1; MySQL Connector Net 6.3.5
////
//// *************************************************************************************
//// ATTRIBUTION: The World DB data files are from the MySQL website tutorial.
////      Some of the code in this program was adapted from the tutorial in the MySQL
////      Connection documentation - see:  start / All Programs / MySQL /
////                      MySQL Server 5.1 / MySQL Connector Net 6.3.5 / Documentation
////
//// NOTE:  The DB Schema which was set up manually using mysql is lacking some
////      commonly accepted "good DB design practices" (e.g., foreign key
////      specifications for specifying connections between tables, unique
////      (candidate key fields) specifications, disallowing non-unique primary keys,
////      etc.).  I have not changed these.
////
//// *************************************************************************************
//// DESCRIPTION: This program USES the World DB.  It assumes the DB's already set up.
////      This set up was done directly in mysql by using script files to
////          CREATE the database, CREATE its tables (with column descriptions),
////          and populate the tables with actual data using INSERTs.
////      Such operations as CREATE, DROP, ALTER (i.e., DDL, Data Definition Language,
////          SQL commands which affect the DB Schema) COULD have been done by a C#
////          program instead.  That's something you can explore later in a DBS course.
////      This program only queries & manipulates the DATA itself using DML (Data
////          Manipulation Language) SQL commands: SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE.
////
//// *************************************************************************************
//// DISCLAIMER:  This program is simplified in order to demonstrate what's needed for
////      a C# program to access a MySQL database.  It uses hard-coded SQL strings right
////      in the program itself, each in its own specific method.  This is poor 
////      programming practice.  First, it is not generic and robust, with the SQL
////      commands actually hard-coded in the program and an individual method defined
////      for each SQL statement.  Secondly, this approaches leaves the database open
////      to security problems, allowing the general program direct access to the
////      database, with possibly questionable SQL statements.
//// A PARAMETERIZED approach is a much safer (and more generic/robust) way to access a
////      database.  (An example of such a program will be posted soon).  A generic set
////      of database access methods are provided for the general program to use.  The
////      program supplies parameter values to indicate which columns, tables, conditions,
////      etc. are wanted, and the database access methods construct the SQL statement
////      based on those parameters, then sends the statement to the database server
////      for processing.

//// *************************************************************************************
//// DISCLAIMER:  This program's series of 9 transactions have some dependencies - e.g.,
////      if the INSERT didn't work, then the subsequent DELETE won't work.  The error
////      trapping needs to be expanded to more appropriately handle various types of
////      problems.
////
//// *************************************************************************************
//// WHAT'S NEEDED FOR A C# PROGRAM TO ACCESS A MYSQL DB:
////
//// 1. ADD A CONNECTION to the MySQL DB server and the particular user & DB by doing:
////      - open Server Explorer window (View / Server Explorer)
////      - right-click Data Connections & select Add Connection
////      - select MySQL Database & click continue
////      - enter the following info:   Server name:  localhost
////                                  User name:  root
////                                  Password:  <whatever yours is - mine's MySQL3310>
////                                  check the box:  Save my password
////                                  Database name:  world   <or whatever one you need>
////      - click Test Connection & click OK
////    The connection IS SAVED for when you next open this project.  To establish the 
////          connection again, open Server Explorer and click on localhost(world) if
////          it's flagged in red.
////    Note that you can see the list of tables in the DB as well as the columns in each
////          table by expanding the + signs in the Server Explorer.
////
//// 2. ADD A REFERENCE to MySQL.Data library by doing:
////      - in Solution Explorer window (do View / Solution Explorer to open it)
////      - right-click on this project's References & select Add Reference
////      - in Add Reference window (under .NET tab) select MySql.Data & click OK
////    Note:  This is SAVED & only needs to be done when first setting up the project.
////
//// 3. INCLUDE the 3 LIBRARIES with using directives (see below):
////          System.Data, MySql.Data, MySql.Data.MySqlClient
////
//// 4. OPEN the connection by declaring a MySqlConnection object, providing the
////          constructor with the connection string with the relevant data (see below).
////    Note that a program could ask an interactive user for data like userName &
////          password to use in building a connection string.
////    IF THE CONNECTION FAILS TO OPEN, start the DB SERVER itself by starting up mysql
////          by opening the Command Prompt client, starting mysql and logging in.
////
//// 5. Use 1 of MySqlCommand's 3 methods (see below) to RETRIEVE/CHANGE the DB's data:
////      ExecuteReader - used to query the DB - results returned in a
////                  MySqlDataReader object, created by ExecuteReader
////      ExecuteScalar - used to RETURN a single value
////      ExecuteNonQuery - used to INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE data
////
//// 6. CLOSE the connection to release resources
